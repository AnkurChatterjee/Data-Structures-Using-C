# Circular Linked List

## Problem Statement

Write a program for circular linked list in C. Each node in the list must have two parts. The 'info' which consists of the data and the 'link' which contains the address of
the next node in the list. The link part of the last node should point to the first node in the list. <br/>
The following operations has to be done on the single linked list - <br/>

1. Create new list
2. Add at beginning
3. Add after a node
4. Delete node
5. Display list
6. Search list
7. Reverse List

The program will prompt the given options and ask the user to select an option. On the selected option, program will return the desired output. The program will keep
on prompting until the user chooses to quit.

While framing the program, keep in mind all the possiblities of input, like asking to delete from an empty list or trying to display an empty list, etc.
